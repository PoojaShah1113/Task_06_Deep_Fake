# Task 06: Deep Fake – AI-Generated Interview Project

## Overview  
This project creates a short AI-generated “deep fake” interview featuring Houston’s basketball coach, based on previous data analysis insights. The final deliverable is a 24-second composite video interview composed of three very brief question-and-answer clips.

---

## Interview Script  
The interview consists of three concise Q&A pairs, each designed to fit an 8-second video segment:

1. **Interviewer:** What was Houston’s biggest strength this season?  
   **Coach:** Definitely our defense—best in the country.

2. **Interviewer:** How can Houston win more games next year?  
   **Coach:** We need to boost our offense even more.

3. **Interviewer:** What’s your top offseason goal?  
   **Coach:** Improve our scoring and keep defending hard.

## Tools Used  

- **Google Flow (Gemini) for generating deep fake video clips** based on the scripted Q&A.  
- **Canva Free Video Editor** to merge the three 8-second clips into one continuous interview video.

## Process Workflow  

1. Scripted a short and natural interview related to data-driven coaching insights.  
2. Used Google Flow to generate three short video clips, each corresponding to a single question and answer.  
3. Merged the clips sequentially using Canva’s free video editing platform.  
4. Exported the final 24-second interview video.

## Challenges and Reflections  

During research and creation, I explored multiple AI video/audio tools including:

- Google Gemini
- Google Flow  
- ChatGPT audio/video plugins  
- Colossyan  
- D-ID  
- Runway

### Challenges  
- Many platforms required **paid subscriptions** to unlock full features (longer clips, watermark removal, premium voices).  
- Free tiers limited clip durations to about 8 seconds, necessitating very short script segments.  
- Some tools had complex interfaces requiring technical knowledge or external software.  
- Exporting and combining videos across tools was a workflow hurdle.  
- Limited voice/avatar options on free tiers reduced diversity and realism.

### Adaptations and Lessons  
- Used concise 8-second clips fitting Google Flow's free limits.  
- Combined video clips with Canva online editor to avoid expensive tools.  
- Prioritized audio quality with simple visuals when video creation was limited.  
- Documented the entire process thoroughly to satisfy the assignment’s emphasis on research and experience.  
- Learned that free AI video tools often require combining multiple platforms and accepting trade-offs.
